## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow (Progressive enhancement)
- Figma to get an idea of spacing and sizing 

### What I learned

I applied my previous knowledge of laying things out and managing customizable settings with custom properties. Keeping the final UI pixel-perfect to the design is always a new learning experience, and as usual, 

I avoided using arbitrary magic numbers to adjust spacing and sizing. Instead, I opted for generally-used values and utilized line-height to address certain spacing issues effectively.

_I noticed the recommended font size of 14px wasn't necessary to achieve the desired UI. The standard 16px base font size worked well, and the basic copy inherited it seamlessly._
